# Task 7: Test Fixes Summary - Round 2

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/container-paths.test.ts`)
- **Issue**: Tests using Windows paths on Linux systems
- **Fix**: Created separate test suites for Windows and Linux using MockPathUtils
- **Result**: Tests now simulate the appropriate OS behavior regardless of host OS

### 2. Session Manager Path Tests (`tests/unit/session/session-manager-paths.test.ts`)
- **Issue**: Using `path.isAbsolute()` which is OS-dependent
- **Fix**: Changed assertion to verify SessionManager passes through paths unchanged
- **Result**: Test passes on all platforms

### 3. E2E Container Path Translation (`tests/e2e/container-path-translation.test.ts`)
- **Issue**: Non-container test using Windows paths on Linux
- **Fix**: Made test platform-aware - uses appropriate paths for the current OS
- **Result**: Test uses Windows paths on Windows, Unix paths on Linux/macOS

## Remaining Issues (Not Related to Path Translation)

### 1. Python Discovery Test (`tests/integration/python-real-discovery.test.ts`)
- **Error**: `spawn node ENOENT`
- **Cause**: Node.js not found in the restricted PATH
- **Status**: Environment setup issue, not path translation

### 2. Container Smoke Test (`tests/e2e/mcp-server-smoke-container.test.ts`)
- **Error**: "Script path not found: /workspace/examples/python/fibonacci.py"
- **Cause**: File doesn't exist in container (mounting issue)
- **Status**: Container configuration issue, not path translation

## Summary

The path translation fixes are complete and working correctly:
- ✅ Container mode rejects ALL absolute paths (Windows and Unix)
- ✅ Non-container mode passes through paths unchanged
- ✅ Tests use MockPathUtils for OS-independent behavior
- ✅ E2E tests are platform-aware

The remaining test failures are due to:
1. Environment setup issues (Node.js path)
2. Container mounting/file existence issues

These are separate concerns from the cross-platform path handling that was fixed.
