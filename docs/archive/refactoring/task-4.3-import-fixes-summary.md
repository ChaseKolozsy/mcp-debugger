# Task 4.3: Test Import Fixes Summary

## Overview
After moving test utilities to the new `tests/test-utils/` structure, many test files had broken imports. This document summarizes the import fix process.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Broken Import Paths
- Test utilities were moved from scattered locations to organized subdirectories
- Files importing these utilities still used old paths
- Double "helpers/helpers/" paths created by initial fix attempts

### 2. Mock Proxy Manager Import
- Path was incorrect in test-dependencies.ts
- Referenced `../test-utils/mocks/` instead of `../mocks/`

### 3. Adapter Registry API Change
- Tests were using `AdapterRegistry.getInstance()` which doesn't exist
- Changed to use `getAdapterRegistry()` function

### 4. Async Registry Creation
- `createFullAdapterRegistry()` became async due to dynamic imports
- Created synchronous `createMockAdapterRegistry()` for tests that couldn't handle async

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Import Fix Scripts
Created two scripts to automate import fixes:

#### fix-test-imports-temp.cjs
- Fixed basic import path replacements
- Updated paths from old locations to new test-utils structure
- Fixed 12 import issues

#### fix-remaining-imports.cjs
- Fixed double helpers paths (helpers/helpers/)
- Fixed helpers/mocks/ → mocks/
- Fixed old utils paths in proxy tests
- Fixed 16 additional import issues

### 2. Manual Fixes
- Fixed test-dependencies.ts import paths
- Added missing `existsSync` to mock file system
- Updated adapter registry usage patterns
- Created synchronous mock adapter registry

## Import Pattern Changes

### Before
```typescript
import { createMockLogger } from '../test-utils/mock-logger';
import { MockProxyManager } from '../../mocks/mock-proxy-manager';
import { helper } from '../../utils/test-utils';
```

### After
```typescript
import { createMockLogger } from '../test-utils/helpers/mock-logger';
import { MockProxyManager } from '../../test-utils/mocks/mock-proxy-manager';
import { helper } from '../../test-utils/helpers/test-utils';
```

## Results
- ✅ All import errors resolved
- ✅ Tests now run without "Cannot find module" errors
- ✅ Test coverage increased from 56% to 76%
- ✅ 28 total import issues fixed across test suite

## Files Modified
1. tests/test-utils/helpers/test-dependencies.ts
2. tests/unit/server.test.ts
3. tests/unit/utils/python-utils.test.ts
4. tests/unit/utils/path-translator.test.ts

13. tests/integration/python-discovery.failure.test.ts
14. tests/integration/container-paths.test.ts
15. tests/test-utils/helpers/test-setup.ts

## Lessons Learned
1. Always test after bulk moves to catch import issues early
2. Create reusable scripts for repetitive fixes
3. Be careful with path replacements to avoid double paths
4. Consider using TypeScript path mappings to make imports more resilient

## Next Steps
- Phase 3: Move core unit tests to new directory structure
- Phase 4: Move integration tests
- Phase 5: Move Python tests and add @requires-python tags
