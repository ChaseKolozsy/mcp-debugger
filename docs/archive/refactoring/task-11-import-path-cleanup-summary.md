# Task 11: Import Path Cleanup - Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Fix ~15 test failures caused by incorrect import paths after Task 4's file reorganization. This was identified as a **HIGH priority, LOW effort** quick win.

## 📊 Initial State
- **~67 test failures** total
- **~15 failures** due to import path issues
- Common errors: "Cannot find module '../../../src/test-utils/mock-logger'"

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Automated Scripts
Executed existing fix scripts in order:
1. `fix-remaining-imports.cjs` - No changes needed
2. `fix-utils-imports.cjs` - No changes needed  
3. `fix-adapter-imports.cjs` - No changes needed
4. `fix-session-imports.cjs` - No changes needed
5. `fix-proxy-imports.cjs` - No changes needed

The scripts had already been run during Task 4, so manual fixes were needed.

### Phase 2: Manual Import Fixes
Fixed import paths in tests that were moved to deeper directories:

#### Fixed Files:
1. **tests/core/integration/container-paths.test.ts**
   - `../../src/` → `../../../src/`
   - Fixed logger and server imports

2. **tests/adapters/python/integration/python-discovery.failure.test.ts**
   - `../../test-utils/` → `../../../test-utils/`
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`

3. **tests/adapters/python/integration/python-discovery.success.test.ts**
   - `../../test-utils/` → `../../../test-utils/`
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`

4. **tests/core/unit/adapters/adapter-registry.test.ts**
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`

5. **tests/core/unit/server/dynamic-tool-documentation.test.ts**
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`
   - Updated mock paths

6. **tests/core/unit/utils/logger.test.ts**
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`

7. **tests/core/unit/utils/path-translator.test.ts**
   - `../../../src/` → `../../../../src/`

## ✅ Results

### Import Path Issues: RESOLVED ✓
- All "Cannot find module" errors related to test imports have been fixed
- Tests can now properly import their dependencies
- No more module resolution errors in the test output

### Remaining Issues (Out of Scope)
- Some tests still fail due to adapter registry initialization issues
- These are functional bugs, not import path problems
- Example: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isLanguageSupported')"

## 📈 Impact
- **Import errors fixed**: ~15 (100% of import-related failures)
- **Tests now able to run**: All test files can be loaded and executed
- **Code coverage running**: 79.26% statement coverage reported
- **Build process**: No longer blocked by import errors

## 🔑 Key Learnings
1. When moving test files to deeper directories, import paths must be adjusted accordingly
2. Automated scripts may not catch all cases, especially for deeply nested files
3. The pattern for fixes was consistent: add one more `../` for each directory level deeper

## 📋 Next Steps
While import paths are now fixed, there are still functional test failures that need attention:
- Fix adapter registry initialization issues
- Address the server test failures related to language support
- Continue with other test recovery tasks from the roadmap

## 🏁 Task Status: COMPLETE ✅
All import path issues have been successfully resolved. The ~15 import-related test failures have been eliminated, achieving the quick win objective of Task 11.
