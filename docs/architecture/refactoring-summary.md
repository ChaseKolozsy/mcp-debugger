  - Removed unnecessary skips
  - Fixed Docker test compatibility
- **Result**: 834/838 tests passing (99.5% success rate)

## Architecture Achievements

### 1. Clean Adapter Pattern
```typescript
// Before: Python-specific
class SessionManager {
  private async spawnPythonDebugger() { }
}

// After: Language-agnostic
class SessionManager {
  constructor(private adapterRegistry: IAdapterRegistry) {}
  private async spawnDebugAdapter(language: string) {
    const adapter = this.adapterRegistry.create(language);
  }
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Interface
- 30+ methods in IDebugAdapter
- Complete lifecycle management
- Environment validation
- Feature detection
- Error handling

### 3. Reference Implementations
- **MockDebugAdapter**: Complete reference for new adapters
- **PythonDebugAdapter**: Production example with debugpy
- Both fully tested and documented

### 4. Robust Testing
- 808 passing tests (99.5% success rate)
- Unit, integration, and E2E coverage
- Mock adapter enables testing without dependencies
- Type safety throughout

## Code Quality Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- Python-specific implementation
- 585 ESLint issues
- Limited test coverage
- Tight coupling

### After Refactoring
- Language-agnostic architecture
- 0 production ESLint errors
- 99.5% test success rate
- 12K+ lines removed (cleaner code)
- Complete type safety

## Migration Impact

### Backward Compatibility
- ~~`pythonPath` parameter still works (deprecated)~~ **UPDATE (2025-07-12)**: Removed, use `executablePath`
- All Python functionality preserved
- ~~Smooth migration path to v1.0~~ **Breaking change**: Direct migration required

### New Capabilities
- Support for multiple languages
- Mock adapter for testing
- Extensible architecture
- Better error messages

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Incremental Refactoring Works
Breaking the refactoring into 27+ focused tasks allowed:
- Continuous validation
- Manageable PR sizes
- Easy rollback if needed
- Clear progress tracking

### 2. Test Infrastructure is Critical
Investing in test infrastructure early paid dividends:
- Mock adapter caught many issues
- E2E tests validated architecture
- Type safety prevented regressions

### 3. Real-World Complexity
Theory vs reality lessons:
- State machines need flexibility
- Path handling is always complex
- DAP protocol has language-specific quirks
- Event timing matters

### 4. Documentation Prevents "Cartoon" Code
- Links to source code keep docs honest
- Real examples beat abstractions
- "Reality Check" sections highlight gotchas

## Future Opportunities

### 1. New Language Adapters
The architecture is ready for:
- Node.js debugging
- Go debugging  
- Rust debugging
- Any language with DAP support

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Adapter pooling
- Lazy loading
- Parallel initialization

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Multi-session debugging
- Remote debugging
- Container debugging improvements

## Summary

This refactoring successfully transformed mcp-debugger from a Python-specific tool into a true multi-language debugging platform. The adapter pattern provides clean separation of concerns, comprehensive testing ensures reliability, and backward compatibility protects existing users.
