# Task 5.1: E2E Test Investigation Summary

## üîç Investigation Results

### 1. Test Scripts Updated Successfully ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "test": "npm run build && vitest run",
  "test:e2e": "vitest run tests/e2e",
  "test:core": "vitest run tests/core",
  "test:python": "vitest run tests/adapters/python"
}
```
- Now correctly runs tests from the reorganized directories
- Previously was missing most tests due to outdated paths

### 2. E2E Test Status

#### ‚úÖ Passing Tests
- **Error Scenarios** - Language rejection (ruby, javascript) now working
- **Error Scenarios** - Invalid session ID handling working
- **Error Scenarios** - Step/stack trace operations when not paused working
- **SSE Smoke Tests** - All passing
- **Stdio Smoke Tests** - All passing

#### ‚ùå Failing Tests

##### 1. **adapter-switching.test.ts**
- Failure: `continue_execution` returns `{success: false}`
- Line 162: Python continue operation failing
- Issue: Likely mock adapter not implementing continue properly

##### 2. **container-path-translation.test.ts** 
- Failure: Path format expectation mismatch
- Expected: `examples/python/fibonacci.py:15`
- Actual: `C:\path\to\project\examples\python\fibonacci.py:15`
- Issue: Test expects relative path but gets absolute

##### 3. **error-scenarios.test.ts**
- Failure: Closed session still accepting operations
- Line 148: `expect(breakpointResult.success).toBe(false)` but gets `true`
- Issue: Session cleanup not preventing further operations

##### 4. **full-debug-session.test.ts**
- Failure: Mock debugging workflow not working
- Line 63: Basic operations returning `{success: false}`
- Issue: Mock adapter incomplete implementation

### 3. Root Causes Identified

#### A. Mock Adapter Implementation Issues
The mock adapter appears to be missing or incorrectly implementing:
- Continue execution operation
- Proper session state management
- Debug workflow operations

#### B. Path Translation Inconsistency
- Tests expect relative paths in responses
- Server returns absolute paths
- Need to standardize path handling in responses

#### C. Session State Management
- Closed sessions still accepting operations
- Session store not properly tracking session state
- Need better validation in session manager

#### D. Error Handling Works! ‚úÖ
The `callToolSafely` helper successfully fixed error tests:
- MCP errors now properly caught and returned as `{success: false}`
- No more uncaught exceptions in error scenarios

### 4. Test Coverage Impact

**Before Script Update:**
- Only running tests in old `tests/unit/` and empty `tests/integration/`
- Missing all reorganized tests

**After Script Update:**
- Now running all tests in correct locations
- Revealed issues that were hidden by not running tests
- Coverage reporting shows 0% (expected with E2E tests)

### 5. Priority Fixes Needed

1. **Mock Adapter Completion** (High Priority)
   - Implement missing DAP operations
   - Fix session state tracking
   - Add proper continue/step operations

2. **Path Response Standardization** (Medium Priority)
   - Decide on relative vs absolute paths in responses
   - Update tests or implementation accordingly

3. **Session Lifecycle Management** (High Priority)
   - Prevent operations on closed sessions
   - Better state validation in session manager

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix mock adapter implementation for basic operations
2. Standardize path handling in tool responses
3. Add session state validation to prevent operations on closed sessions

### Test Organization Success
- The test script updates successfully exposed hidden issues
- All tests are now being run from correct locations
- The reorganization is complete and working

### Next Steps
1. Fix the identified implementation issues
2. Re-run tests to verify fixes
3. Clean up old test directories once all tests pass

## üìä Summary

The test investigation revealed that:
- ‚úÖ Test reorganization is complete and scripts are updated
- ‚úÖ Error handling has been successfully fixed
- ‚ùå Mock adapter needs completion
- ‚ùå Path handling needs standardization
- ‚ùå Session state management needs improvement

The good news is that the testing infrastructure is now correctly set up to catch these issues. The failures are legitimate implementation problems, not test configuration issues.
