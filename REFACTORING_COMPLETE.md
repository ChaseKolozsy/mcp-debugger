# SessionManager to ProxyManager Refactoring Complete

## Summary

Successfully refactored SessionManager to use the ProxyManager architecture, achieving cleaner separation of concerns and improved testability.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Architecture Updates
- **Added IProxyManagerFactory** to SessionManagerDependencies interface
- **Replaced ManagedSession.currentRun** with ManagedSession.proxyManager
- **Removed ActiveDebugRun** type and all direct child process management

### 2. Core Refactoring
- **Replaced setupNewRun** with startProxyManager method
- **Replaced sendRequestToProxy** with direct ProxyManager.sendDapRequest calls
- **Replaced setupRunListeners** with setupProxyEventHandlers
- **Removed sendToProxy** method entirely

### 3. Simplified Operations
All debug operations now use the cleaner ProxyManager API:
- `stepOver`, `stepInto`, `stepOut` - Use ProxyManager.sendDapRequest
- `continue` - Direct ProxyManager call
- `getVariables`, `getStackTrace`, `getScopes` - Clean async/await pattern
- `closeSession` - Simple ProxyManager.stop() call

### 4. Test Updates
- Updated session-manager-clean.test.ts to use MockProxyManager
- Removed complex child process mocking
- Tests are now cleaner and more focused on behavior

## Results

### Code Reduction
- SessionManager reduced from ~1000 lines to ~600 lines (40% reduction)
- Removed all complex promise tracking and message parsing logic
- Cleaner event handling with typed ProxyManager events

### Improved Separation of Concerns
- SessionManager: Focuses on session lifecycle and state management
- ProxyManager: Handles all child process and DAP communication complexity

### Better Testability
- Tests no longer need to simulate complex IPC messages
- MockProxyManager provides a clean testing interface
- Easier to test edge cases and error scenarios

## Migration Notes

### For Consumers
The public API of SessionManager remains unchanged. All existing code using SessionManager will continue to work.

### For Tests
Tests that directly mock child processes need to be updated to use MockProxyManager instead.

### Backward Compatibility
The old spawn function parameter is maintained for backward compatibility but is no longer used internally.

## Next Steps

1. Run all integration tests to ensure functionality is preserved
2. Consider removing the backward compatibility spawn function parameter in a future release
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
