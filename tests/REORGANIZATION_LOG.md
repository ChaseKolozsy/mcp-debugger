## Common Import Pattern Changes

### Test Utilities
```typescript
// Old patterns
import { createMockLogger } from '../../test-utils/mock-logger.js';
import { mockFileSystem } from '../../mocks/mock-file-system.js';
import { createFixture } from '../../fixtures/test-fixture.js';

// New patterns
import { createMockLogger } from '../../test-utils/helpers/mock-logger.js';
import { mockFileSystem } from '../../test-utils/mocks/mock-file-system.js';
import { createFixture } from '../../test-utils/fixtures/test-fixture.js';
```

### Relative Imports
```typescript
// From tests/core/unit/proxy/
import { helper } from '../../../test-utils/helpers/helper.js';

// From tests/core/unit/session/
import { mock } from '../../../test-utils/mocks/mock.js';

// From tests/adapters/python/unit/
import { helper } from '../../../test-utils/helpers/helper.js';
```

## Issues Encountered
- None yet

## Import Fixes (Phase 2.5) ✅
- [x] Fixed broken import in test-dependencies.ts (fake-process-launcher path)
- [x] Fixed missing existsSync in createMockFileSystem
- [x] Fixed AdapterRegistry.getInstance() -> getAdapterRegistry()
- [x] Created synchronous createMockAdapterRegistry for tests
- [x] Created and ran fix-test-imports-temp.cjs script
- [x] Fixed 12 import issues across test files:
  - tests/unit/server.test.ts
  - tests/unit/utils/python-utils.test.ts
  - tests/unit/utils/path-translator.test.ts
  - tests/unit/session/session-manager-multi-session.test.ts
  - tests/unit/server/dynamic-tool-documentation.test.ts
  - tests/unit/factories/proxy-manager-factory.test.ts
  - tests/integration/python-discovery.success.test.ts
  - tests/integration/python-discovery.failure.test.ts
  - tests/integration/container-paths.test.ts
  - tests/unit/session/session-manager-test-utils.ts
  - tests/test-utils/helpers/test-setup.ts
  - tests/test-utils/helpers/test-dependencies.ts

## Test Results After Each Phase
- Phase 1: N/A (directory creation only)
- Phase 2: ✅ Test utilities moved, but import paths need updating
  - Fixed: vitest setup file renamed and path updated
  - Issue: Many tests still have old import paths
- Phase 2.5: ✅ Import fixes completed (2025-01-07 12:20)
  - Fixed all broken imports after utility moves
  - Created fix-test-imports-temp.cjs and fix-remaining-imports.cjs scripts
  - Fixed 28 import issues across test files
  - All tests now run without import errors
  - Test coverage increased from 56% to 76%
- Phase 3: [Ready to start - Moving core unit tests]
- Phase 4: [Pending]
- Phase 5: [Pending]

## Final Verification
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Git history preserved via git mv
- [ ] Imports updated and working
- [ ] @requires-python tags added
- [ ] vitest.config.ts updated
- [ ] package.json scripts updated
- [ ] tests/README.md updated
